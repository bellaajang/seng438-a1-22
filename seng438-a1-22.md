# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab.

During this lab,we focused on learning more about exploratory, regrssion and manual functional testing. This was mainly acheived through gaining practical experience by testing the java based bank system presented in this lab. All the testing that was done was logged on "Atlassian Jira", a tracking software our team was not familiar with prior to the lab. In order, we started with exploratory testing, which involved the bulk of our pair testing. Then we did manual scripted testing twice, with the second covering regression testing. Across the team, nobody had any knowledge of what any of these testing methods entailed, only basic definitions.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing involves a testing with the requirments of the overall functionality of the program taken into account. Our high-level exploratory testing plan involved testing all the functions of the application, with the functions being derived from the high-level requirmenets(Appendix B). Of the funtions we chose we, we mainly used broad testing with only a few functions getting more testing than others(like withdraws and deposits). Lastly, our test case strategy was only focused on  common user paths.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
A comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing (based on the provided test suite) from several perspectives (e.g., benefits, tradeoffs, effectiveness, efficiency, etc.)

As stated previously, exploratory testing involves testing 

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

For the difficulties encountered, exploratory testing was particularly challenging since we had to make our own testing approach and determine which aspects to focus on, balancing common scenarios with edge cases. Additionally, using Jira for the first time required effort to understand issue reporting, tracking, and managing versions. Regression testing also introduced complexities, as some errors appeared partially fixed, requiring additional clarification and documentation. 

As for lessons learned, we learned that writing clear and detailed bug reports, including steps to reproduce and expected vs. actual results, was necessary for effective error tracking. Exploratory testing helped uncover issues that scripted tests did not cover, showing even more unexpected behaviors in the program. Lastly, learning how to navigate error tracking tools like Jira improved our ability to manage and track bugs efficiently.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself. (Did you find it a useful practice? Was it easy to follow?) Please try to keep comments and feedback constructive.

The lab provided a very useful practice in understanding concepts of software testing, such as exploratory testing, bug tracking, and regression testing. It gave us hands-on experience with real-world tools (Jira) and exposed us to different testing methods. The structured approach with clear stages made it easy to follow the progression from getting familiar with the program to reporting errors and finally doing regression testing.
