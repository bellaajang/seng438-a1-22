# Introduction

In this lab, we focused on exploratory, regression, and manual functional testing by getting hands-on practice with a simulated ATM system. We logged all our testing in Atlassian Jira, which was new to our team. Exploratory testing, where we tested the system freely without following specific steps, made up most of our pair testing. Manual testing, where we followed written steps to check specific functions, was done twice, the second time focusing on regression testing. Before this lab, our team only knew these basic definitions and didn’t have any real experience with these testing methods.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing is about testing with the overall functionality and requirements of the program in mind. Our high-level plan was to go through all the key functions of the application, which we picked out based on the high-level requirements (Appendix B). We aimed to cover all main transactions, but some functions, like withdrawals and deposits, got more attention since they seemed the most important and had a higher chance of breaking. Most of our testing focused on broad coverage, and our test case strategy was all about following common user paths to see how the system worked in real-world scenarios.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
A comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing (based on the provided test suite) from several perspectives (e.g., benefits, tradeoffs, effectiveness, efficiency, etc.)

As stated previously, exploratory testing involves testing 

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

During the peer review process of the defect reports created by each pair in our group, we encountered differences in findings as well as some redundancy. To ensure a more thorough and accurate review, we compared our reports, shared our perspectives, and refined our evaluations collaboratively.

To eliminate redundancy, we eliminated repeated defects into a single entry where appropriate. Additionally, when one pair identified a defect that another pair had overlooked, we discussed its validity as a group and reached a consensus on whether it should be included. This collaborative approach helped improve the quality and accuracy of our defect reports.Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports created by each pair in a group.	

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Pair testing was done with Joan and Suyoung in one pair and Joseph and Raghav in the other. Both pairs followed the same approach, one person handled the testing while the other reviewed and analyzed the results. We made sure to rotate roles within each pair to keep things balanced. When it came to teamwork and effort, everyone contributed equally, with each person taking on 25% of the assignment.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

For the difficulties encountered, exploratory testing was particularly challenging since we had to make our own testing approach and determine which aspects to focus on, balancing common scenarios with edge cases. Additionally, using Jira for the first time required effort to understand issue reporting, tracking, and managing versions. Regression testing also introduced complexities, as some errors appeared partially fixed, requiring additional clarification and documentation. 

As for lessons learned, we learned that writing clear and detailed bug reports, including steps to reproduce and expected vs. actual results, was necessary for effective error tracking. Exploratory testing helped uncover issues that scripted tests did not cover, showing even more unexpected behaviors in the program. Lastly, learning how to navigate error tracking tools like Jira improved our ability to manage and track bugs efficiently.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The lab provided a very useful practice in understanding concepts of software testing, such as exploratory testing, bug tracking, and regression testing. It gave us hands-on experience with real-world tools (Jira) and exposed us to different testing methods. The structured approach with clear stages made it easy to follow the progression from getting familiar with the program to reporting errors and finally doing regression testing.
