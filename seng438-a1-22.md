# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab.

During this lab,we focused on learning more about exploratory, regrssion and manual functional testing. This was mainly acheived through gaining practical experience by testing the java based bank system presented in this lab. All the testing that was done was logged on "Atlassian Jira", a tracking software our team was not familiar with prior to the lab. In order, we started with exploratory testing, which involved the bulk of our pair testing. Then we did manual scripted testing twice, with the second covering regression testing. Across the team, nobody had any knowledge of what any of these testing methods entailed, only bsic definitions.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing involves a testing with the requirments of the overall functionality of the program taken into account. Our high-level exploratory testing plan involved testing all the functions of the application, with the functions being derived from the high-level requirmenets(Appendix B). Of the funtions we chose we, we mainly used broad testing with only a few functions getting more testing than others(like withdraws and deposits). Lastly, our test case strategy was only focused on  common user paths.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
A comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing (based on the provided test suite) from several perspectives (e.g., benefits, tradeoffs, effectiveness, efficiency, etc.)

As stated previously, exploratory testing involves testing 

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports
